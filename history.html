    <div class="text-section">
      <h1>Early Roots (12th–18th Century)</h1>
      <p>The origins of manga can be traced back to Chōjū-jinbutsu-giga (鳥獣人物戯画), a series of picture scrolls from the 12th century that depicted animals with human characteristics in humorous scenes. These scrolls already utilized sequential storytelling, similar to modern manga.

        During the Edo period (1603–1868), the ukiyo-e (浮世絵, "pictures of the floating world") art style became popular. The painter Hokusai, famous for his woodblock prints, used the term “manga” for a series of his casual sketches in Hokusai Manga (1814), although the meaning was different from today.
        
        Another popular format was kibyōshi (illustrated books with satirical content), which closely resembled modern comics.</p>

        <h1>Meiji Era and Western Influence (1868–1912)</h1>
        <p>With Japan's modernization, Western influences began to emerge. Rakuten Kitazawa (1876–1955) was among the first artists to use the word "manga" to describe comic stories.

            Printing technology improved, enabling the creation of illustrated magazines with elements of sequential storytelling.</p>

        <h1>Pre-war and Wartime Manga (1912–1945)</h1>
        <p>In the early 20th century, manga began to take its modern form. Artists like Ippei Okamoto and Osamu Tezuka were inspired by American and European comics.

            During World War II, manga was often used as propaganda, but underground artists continued to create humorous and satirical stories.</p>

      <div class="text-section">
        <h1>Post-war Boom and Osamu Tezuka (1945–1960s)</h1>
        <p>After the war, manga’s popularity exploded, largely thanks to Osamu Tezuka (1928–1989), who is called the "God of Manga."

            His work New Treasure Island (新宝島, 1947) introduced cinematic storytelling techniques, dynamic panels, and deeper characters.
            
            Among his famous works are Astro Boy (鉄腕アトム, 1952), Black Jack, and Phoenix. His style influenced an entire generation of artists.
            
            The phenomenon of rental manga libraries (kashihon manga) also emerged, where future famous authors like Shigeru Mizuki (GeGeGe no Kitaro) started their careers.</p>
